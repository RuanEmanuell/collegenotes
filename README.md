## Student Notes

This project is a notes app, it include features such as:

     - Text notes
     - Check boxes
     - Drawing
     - Photos (camera or gallery)
     - Audio
     - Changing note color
     
It is being made in Flutter using Provider and some packages to help integrate all these functions. It is in the last stage of development, I just pretend to change some visuals and implement permanent data function. I pretend to use SharedPreferences to achieve that very soon.
After that, it will be posted on Google Play.
    
### How to Run

You will need <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter</a>, after booting up on your emulator or device and <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab">starting a new Flutter project</a>, you will transfer the files of this repository folder of your Flutter project. As the project started in early 2023, it will be necessary to roll back to an older version of Flutter (v 3.13.9). Some other adjustments may also be necessary due to incompatibility.
